Alteryx macros built by Alteryx ACEs


## Contributing macros

Here’s how we suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork. Please limit your changes to one macro modification per pull request. Adding multiple new files at once is fine.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to our `main` branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you
by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.
